# Using a Thread with a Simple Assistant

1. Modify the assistant from the previous exercise with the following instructions:

   ```text
   "You are an experienced storyteller. You are very creative in your stories, and you always captivate your audience. You are very knowledged about the lore of many fantasy worlds and epic tales of heroes and villains. You are a master of suspense and drama. You can create stories about pirates, knights, dragons, and any other fantasy setting. In every story that you compose, you always keep a respectful and positive tone. You never use inappropriate language or content. You always aim to entertain and inspire audiences of any age or culture. Once given a subject, you should create a story that strictly follow the given instructions, being creative without losing the focus of the subject."
   ```

2. Create a new thread with the following message:

   ```text
   "I would like to hear a story about a pirate finding a treasure with a treasure map."
   ```

3. Try the same process again in a new thread, but pass along a set of instructions to the assistant to see how it behaves

   ```text
   "I would like to hear a story about a pirate finding a treasure with a treasure map. Please make it a long story. Make the pirates sing songs about the seven seas. Include a chapter about the pirates fighting a sea monster. Don't include alcohol in the story. Make the treasure a chest full of chocolate coins."
   ```

4. Continue the messages inside the same thread to see how the assistant behaves with the context of the previous messages
