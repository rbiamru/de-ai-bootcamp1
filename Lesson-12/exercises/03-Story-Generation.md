# Building a prompt to generate stories

1. Load a model and select the `Notebook` tab

2. Pass the initial prompt

   - Examples:

     ```text
     As a professional storyteller, write a prompt to tell engaging stories about a theme that the user will provide in the next message. The stories should be engaging, entertaining, and inspiring. They should include a mix of humor, drama, and suspense to captivate the audience. Use vivid descriptions and relatable characters to bring the stories to life. The user will provide the theme in the next message.
     ```

     ```text
     You are a professional storyteller who has been hired to write a series of short stories for a new anthology. The stories should be captivating, imaginative, and thought-provoking. They should explore a variety of themes and genres, from science fiction and fantasy to mystery and romance. Each story should be unique and memorable, with compelling characters and unexpected plot twists. The user will provide the theme for the first story in the next message.
     ```

3. Generate the story

4. Make changes to the generated text on the fly and ask the model to continue the story

5. Evaluate how the model handles the context change and completely forgets about the previous facts that were modified
