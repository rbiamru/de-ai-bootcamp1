# Creating an Application with Vercel AI SDK

1. Create your project

   - This will set up a new project for you using Next.js templates

   - Open your terminal and type the following command:

   `npx create-next-app my-ai-app`

2. Choose the correct options for each step

   - When asked `Ok to proceed? (y)` press 'Enter' to confirm

   - When asked `Would you like to use TypeScript? › No / Yes` pick default option `Yes`

   - When asked `Would you like to use ESLint? › No / Yes` pick default option `Yes`

   - When asked `Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? › No / Yes` pick default option `Yes`

   - When asked `Would you like to use src/ directory? › No / Yes` pick default option `No`

   - When asked `Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) › No / Yes` pick default option `Yes`

   - When asked `Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)?` pick default option `No`

   - Wait for the installation to finish

   > Notice that the default options might change in some cases, so make sure to read the instructions carefully and choose the correct options for your project

3. Navigate to the created folder

   - The command you ran in step 1 created a new folder called 'my-ai-app'

   - You need to navigate into this folder using the following command:

   `cd my-ai-app`

4. Install the suggested dependencies

   - These are the libraries that your project needs to run

   - Install them with the following command:

   `npm install ai @ai-sdk/react @ai-sdk/openai zod`

   - Wait for the installation to finish

5. Open the project in VSCode

   - Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a code editor where you can write and manage your code

   - Open your project in VSCode with the following command:

   `code .`

   - Alternatively, you can open it manually by finding the 'my-ai-app' folder on your computer, right-clicking it, and choosing 'Open with VSCode'

   - If you don't have the 'Open with VSCode' option, you can open VSCode and use the 'File' > 'Open Folder' option to navigate to the 'my-ai-app' folder

6. Create a `.env` file

   - This is a special file where you can store things like API keys

   - In the root folder of your project, create a new file named `.env`

7. Paste the API key: You need an API key to use OpenAI's services

   - Paste `OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxx` into the `.env` and save the file

8. Get an API Key: This is the same key you set up in Exercise 2 of Lesson 04

   - If you have the key set up in your OS environment variables, you can get it by running `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY` in your terminal

     - Even if you have it set up in your environment variables in your development machine, it's a good idea to store it in the `.env` file for this project, since later on you might need to handle different environments (like development, testing, and production) for the same project with NextJS using different `.env` files for each

   - If you've lost you API Key, don't worry, you can get a new one from your [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) configuration page

9. Replace the placeholder key: In the `.env` file, replace `xxxxx` with the OpenAI API key you got in the previous step and save the file

   - Your `.env` file should look something like this: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxx`

10. Create a new file for instructing NextJS how to handle the API calls to OpenAI:

    - In the root of your project, find the `app` folder and create a new folder inside it named `api`

    - Inside the `api` folder, create another new folder named `chat`

    - Inside the `chat` folder, create a new file named `route.ts`

    - Open the `route.ts` file and paste the code:

    ```typescript
    import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
    import { streamText } from 'ai';
    
    // Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
    export const maxDuration = 30;
    
    export async function POST(req: Request) {
      const { messages } = await req.json();
    
      const result = streamText({
        model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
        messages,
      });
    
      return result.toDataStreamResponse();
    }
    ```

11. Modify the UI with the chat components:

    - In VSCode, open the file 'page.tsx' inside the folder 'app'

    - Replace the existing code with the following:

    ```typescript
    "use client";

    import { useChat } from "@ai-sdk/react";

    export default function Chat() {
      const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();
      return (
        <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
          {messages.map((m) => (
            <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
              {m.role === "user" ? "User: " : "AI: "}
              {m.content}
            </div>
          ))}

          <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
              className="fixed bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl text-black"
              value={input}
              placeholder="Say something..."
              onChange={handleInputChange}
            />
          </form>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

12. Run the application: Now that everything is set up, you can start your application

    - On your terminal, run the following command:

    `npm run dev`

    - If everything is okay, you can now access the application at <http://localhost:3000/>
