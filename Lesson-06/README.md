# Lesson 06: Building AI Applications with NextJS and Vercel

In the previous lesson, we grasped the basics of frontend development. Now, we'll delve into building, styling, and deploying AI applications with NextJS and Vercel. We'll explore advanced UI/UX practices and utilize Tailwind CSS for efficient styling.

We'll also learn to leverage the Vercel NextJS AI SDK to accelerate development, taking advantage of its numerous "out-of-the-box" features.

Finally, we'll clone and run a sample project from Vercel, using it as a foundation to construct our own AI application.

## Building an Application Using Vercel NextJS AI SDK

- Leveraging boilerplate code and SDKs
- The Vercel [NextJS AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction)

  - Getting started with the SDK
    - Installation process
    - Implementing React Server Components
    - Utilizing providers
    - Streaming chat responses from APIs
    - Configuring Server Actions
  - Following the [Quick Start Guide](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/getting-started/nextjs-app-router) for App Router
  - Exploring the Vercel [AI SDK UI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview) library
    - [Chatbot](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot) example

- Practical exercises
  - Exercise 1: [Creating a simple web application with AI](./exercises/00-Vercel-NextJS-AI-SDK.md) to explore Vercel AI SDK utilities for the [OpenAI Provider](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/legacy-providers/openai)
    - Develop and run a basic project using Vercel NextJS AI SDK
  - Exercise 2: Enhance functionality by creating a [Chef GPT Page](./exercises/01-Chef-GPT-Page.md) to explore NextJS capabilities
    - Modify the project from Exercise 1 to incorporate new features

## Deploying the Application to a Hosting Service

- Web application hosting

  - Post-development, applications need deployment to make them accessible online
    - Static websites (HTML, CSS, JS) can utilize services like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or file servers like [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
    - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Serverless Functions require services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for server-side processing and API endpoints
  - Numerous free and paid hosting services are available
    - Selection depends on application requirements, budget, expected traffic, needed features, and desired developer control
    - For educational purposes, we'll use Vercel, which offers a suitable free tier for most projects

- CI/CD and DevOps for web applications

  - Automating deployment for code changes
    - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) streamline this process
    - These tools create pipelines for automatic building and deployment upon code pushes
  - Vercel's free plan enables direct deployment from public GitHub repositories
    - Simplifies deployment by connecting the repository to Vercel for automatic updates
    - Vercel CLI allows command-line deployments, useful for non-GitHub hosted applications
  - Environment variables require separate configuration on Vercel

    - Set in the [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables) section of project settings
    - Used for API keys, URLs, and sensitive information that shouldn't be hardcoded

- Practical exercise
  - Exercise 3: Use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to [deploy the project](./exercises/02-Deploy-Project.md) and make it publicly accessible
    - Deploy the project from previous exercises and publish it
