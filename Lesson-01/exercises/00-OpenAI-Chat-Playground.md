     - Frequency penalty: `0.5`
     - Presence penalty: `0.6`

3. Click on `Submit`
4. Wait for the response from `Assistant`
5. Ask a follow-up question like "_What are the best amusements for kids there?_" or similar

## Parameters

- **Agent description**: This plays a crucial role in guiding the AI's behavior and response style. Different descriptions can set the tone, personality, and approach of the model.

  - Example: "You are a creative storyteller" would prompt the AI to adopt a more imaginative and narrative style, whereas "You are a technical expert" might lead to more detailed and specific technical information in responses.

- **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of the responses.

  - Lower temperature (0.0-0.3): More predictable, conservative responses, ideal for factual or specific queries.
  - Higher temperature (0.7-1.0): More creative and varied responses, useful for brainstorming or creative writing.

- **Max Tokens (Length)**: Sets the maximum length of the response.

  - Lower range (50-100 tokens): Suitable for concise, straightforward answers.
  - Higher range (150-500 tokens): Suitable for more detailed explanations or narratives.

- **Stop Sequence**: A list of up to four sequences of tokens that, when generated, signal the model to stop generating text. Useful for controlling response length or preventing off-topic content.

- **Top P (Nucleus Sampling)**: Determines the breadth of word choices considered by the model.

  - Lower setting (0.6-0.8): More predictable text, good for formal or factual writing.
  - Higher setting (0.9-1.0): Allows for more creativity and divergence, ideal for creative writing or generating unique ideas.

- **Frequency Penalty**: Reduces the likelihood of the model repeating the same word or phrase.

  - Lower setting (0.0-0.5): Allows some repetition, useful for emphasis in writing or speech.
  - Higher setting (0.5-1.0): Minimizes repetition, helpful for generating diverse and expansive content.

- **Presence Penalty**: Discourages the model from mentioning the same topic or concept repeatedly.
  - Lower setting (0.0-0.5): Suitable for focused content on a specific topic.
  - Higher setting (0.5-1.0): Encourages the model to explore a wider range of topics, useful for brainstorming or exploring different aspects of a subject.
