# Lesson 01: Introduction to AI

In this lesson, we will introduce the basic concepts of AI, its capabilities and limitations, while debunking some myths and misconceptions about it. We will also discuss practical uses of AI with an example of using ChatGPT for performing text-to-text tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Nothing special
  - Just be curious and willing to learn
  - (Optional) Have a good source of hydration and a comfortable place to sit
    - And maybe some snacks?

## What is AI?

- AI before November 30, 2022
  - First formal mention of AI was in [1956 by John McCarthy](https://home.dartmouth.edu/about/artificial-intelligence-ai-coined-dartmouth)
  - First decades of AI focused on rule-based systems
    - AI was seen as a way to **automate** tasks that required human intelligence
  - By early 2000s, AI applications became more common, especially in digital environments
    - AIs for marketing, customer service, and other digital tasks
    - AIs for search engines, recommendation systems, and other digital services
    - AIs for games, simulations, and other digital entertainment
- November 30, 2022 -> ChatGPT launch date
- AI now
  - With ChatGPT (and all similar generative AI tools that followed), AI has entered an age of **mass adoption**
  - AI is now used to **create** content, not just to **automate** tasks
  - AI is now used to (attempt to) _"understand"_ content, not just to **process** data
  - AI is now used to **generate** brand new content, not just to **recommend** or slightly **modify** existing content

## Learning Practical AI Applications

- Prerequisites
  - A computer or similar device
  - Internet connection
  - Dedication
  - Time
- Everything else will be covered as we progress through this bootcamp

## AI Bootcamp

- Example of AI application: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

> Did someone program the application to understand and generate text for each single word in each single language?
>
> > No, the application was **trained** to _"understand"_ and generate text

- How to **train** an application?
  - Applications are pieces of **software** that run on a **computer**
  - How do we **train** a **computer**?
- Machine learning

> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." [Tom M Mitchell et al](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html)

- Does it mean that the computer is _"learning"_?
- Does it mean that the computer is _"thinking"_?
- Does it mean that the computer is _"conscious"_?

## AI Tasks

- Programming a system or application to solve a specific task can take a lot of time and effort, depending on the complexity of the task and the number of edge cases that need to be considered
  - Imagine programming a system to translate text from one language to another by looking up words in a dictionary and applying grammar rules, comparing contexts, and considering idiomatic expressions for every single word in every single variation of their usage
    - Such applications are simply not feasible to be programmed by hand, not even by a huge team of programmers
- For these situations, **AI Models** can be **trained** for statistically solving the task without necessarily handling the actual _"reasoning"_ or _"understanding"_ of the task
  - The **training** process is done by **feeding** the model with **examples** of the task and the **correct** answers
  - The **model** then _"learns"_ the **patterns** and **rules** that **statistically** solve the task
  - The **model** can then **predict** the **correct** answer for new **examples** that it has never seen before

## Capabilities and Limitations of AI

- [Stochastic parrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrots)
  - A critique view of current LLMs (large language models)
    - LLMs are limited by the data they are trained by and are simply stochastically repeating contents of datasets
    - Because they are just "making up" outputs based on training data, LLMs do not _understand_ if they are saying something incorrect or inappropriate
- [The Chinese Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) philosophical experiment presented by John Searle in 1980
  - The notion of machine _understanding_
  - The implementation of syntax alone would constitute semantics?
  - A _simulation_ of mentality can be considered as a **replication** of mentality?
- Can AI truly "understand" language?
  - What is, indeed, "understanding"?
    - [Aristotle. (350 BCE). Metaphysics.](https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.html): Knowledge of causes
    - [Locke, J. (1690). An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10615/10615-h/10615-h.htm): Perception of agreement or disagreement of ideas
    - [Dilthey, W. (1900). The Rise of Hermeneutics.](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780691188706-006/html?lang=en): Interpretive process of making meaning

  - As of our current knowledge, to "understand" means:
    - To grasp the meaning or significance of information
      - Example: Recognizing that "It's raining cats and dogs" is an idiom, not a literal statement
      - Example: Interpreting a graph showing climate change trends over time
    - To process and interpret data in a meaningful way
      - Example: Analyzing sales figures to identify seasonal patterns
      - Example: Interpreting medical test results to diagnose a condition
    - To apply knowledge in various contexts appropriately
      - Example: Using algebra skills to calculate a tip at a restaurant
    - To make logical inferences and connections
      - Example: Deducing that a suspect is left-handed based on crime scene evidence
      - Example: Connecting historical events to understand their impact on current geopolitics
      - Example: Understanding the role of technology advancements in shaping the social and political changes in the past centuries
    - To recognize patterns and relationships
      - Example: Identifying the Fibonacci sequence in nature
      - Example: Noticing correlations between diet and health outcomes in a study
    - To adapt knowledge to new situations
      - Example: Using cooking skills to improvise a meal with limited ingredients
    - To communicate ideas effectively
      - Example: Explaining a complex scientific concept to a child
    - To solve problems using acquired knowledge
      - Example: Troubleshooting a malfunctioning computer using technical expertise
      - Example: Resolving a conflict between coworkers using conflict resolution strategies
    - To demonstrate awareness of one's own thought processes
      - Example: Recognizing and correcting one's own biases in decision-making
    - To exhibit creativity in applying understanding
      - Example: Combining ingredients in novel ways to create a new recipe
- The current capabilities of AI models
  - Limited to "statistical" reasoning
  - Infer answers based on patterns and correlations in data
    - Often the correct answer is very similar to wrong answers (hallucinations)
  - The architectures of the current most popular models (as of early 2025) are not able to process [neuro-symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI) parameters
- **Weak AI** vs **Strong AI**
  - Weak AI: Designed for specific tasks, lacks general intelligence
  - Strong AI: Hypothetical AI with human-like general intelligence
- Concept of **AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence)
  - AI with human-level cognitive abilities across various domains
  - Ability to transfer knowledge between different tasks
  - Potential to surpass human intelligence in many areas

  - Hermes 3 405B [empty system prompt response](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meet-hermes-3-the-powerful-new-open-source-ai-model-that-has-existential-crises/)
    - Impression of consciousness due to the amount of similar data present in the training set (possibly role-playing game texts)

## Practical Uses of Generative AI

- Dealing with text inputs
  - What is **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
