# DeAI Bootcamp

Presented by [Encode Club](https://www.encode.club/)

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Decentralized AI Applications Bootcamp**. This repository houses all the necessary instructions and resources for an immersive 8-week program designed to equip students with cutting-edge techniques for developing applications using **Generative Artificial Intelligence** and **Decentralized Computing** technologies.

Our bootcamp emphasizes a **hands-on** and **project-based** approach, allowing students to learn concepts and immediately apply them to real-world challenges. While we don't dive into the depths of AI and Machine Learning research itself, our focus is on the **practical applications** of AI technology across various industries.

Throughout this program, students will gain proficiency in utilizing the latest generative AI models and tools. They'll learn to construct applications capable of _comprehending_ **natural language** inputs and generating diverse content, including text and images.

Upon successful completion of the bootcamp, participants will have acquired:

- A comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art AI models and tools
- Expertise in Web3 technologies for Decentralized Computing for AI
- Familiarity with industry best practices and advanced techniques in AI development
- The capability to independently develop applications incorporating AI features

## Bootcamp Material

All bootcamp materials are accessible within this repository. The content is organized into folders, with each folder representing a day's lesson. These folders contain comprehensive lesson materials, including hands-on exercises, implementation examples, illustrated instructions, and step-by-step guides to follow during the lesson.

> **Important**: Each folder contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions for the day. Students are strongly advised to clone the repository and prepare all required software and tools **prior to the lesson time**. This preparation enables students to follow the lessons and complete exercises concurrently with the instructor.
>
> Each lesson requires specific software and tools to be installed on the student's device/computer. The `README.md` file for each day provides a comprehensive list of required software and tools. The installation and configuration steps may vary in duration, ranging from several minutes to hours, depending on the student's device specifications.

## Hands-on Lessons

To maximize learning, students should prepare their own development environment to actively participate in the lessons. Each day, they will learn by replicating the instructor's steps and applying newly acquired concepts to real-world projects.

> **Note**: All lessons will be recorded and made available for later review, allowing students to revisit the material at their own pace if needed.
>
> The recorded material is strictly confidential and **must not** be shared with anyone outside the bootcamp.

Students are encouraged to ask questions and seek assistance from instructors and mentors during the lessons. Additional support is available through dedicated channels on the bootcamp's Discord server.

We strongly encourage students to collaborate on group projects, share discoveries, learn from peers, and assist one another in completing project challenges.
