# Lesson 17: Introduction to Web3 and Smart Contracts

In our previous lessons, we explored how AI models can be enhanced with RAG and how they can be integrated into applications. Now, we'll take a step into the world of Web3 and blockchain technology, which offers new possibilities for AI applications through decentralization and smart contracts.

Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, characterized by decentralization, blockchain technology, and token-based economics. This new paradigm enables AI applications to operate in a trustless, transparent, and decentralized manner, opening up possibilities for verifiable AI computations and decentralized AI marketplaces.

## Web3 Fundamentals

- Decentralization and distributed systems
  - Peer-to-peer networks enable direct communication between participants
  - Consensus mechanisms ensure agreement on network state
  - Trust-minimized systems reduce reliance on central authorities
  - Reference blockchains:

    - [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)

- Blockchain technology
  - Blocks and chains create an immutable record of transactions
  - Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity
  - Public and private keys enable secure transactions
  - Digital signatures verify transaction authenticity

## Practical Implementation

Let's create a practical example of a smart contract that can interact with AI agents:

1. Contract Design
   - Define the contract's purpose and functionality
   - Design the data structures and state variables
   - Plan the interaction points with AI agents
   - Consider gas optimization and security measures

2. Development Process
   - Write the contract in Solidity
   - Test the contract locally
   - Deploy to a test network
   - Integrate with AI agents

3. Testing and Verification
   - Perform security audits
   - Test all contract functions
   - Verify gas efficiency
   - Ensure proper AI agent integration

## Practical Exercises

- Exercise 1: [Interacting with an Example Smart Contract](./exercises/00-Interacting-with-an-Example-Smart-Contract.md) for executing a Token Swap
- Exercise 2: [Creating a Fungible Token](./exercises/01-Create-Fungible-Token.md)
  - Use OpenZeppelin Wizard to create an ERC20 token
  - Deploy the token to Sepolia testnet
  - Interact with the deployed contract
