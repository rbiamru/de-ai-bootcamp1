## Exploring Federated Learning for Decentralized AI

### Core Concepts

- Moving Computation to Data
  - Reverse of traditional centralized learning
  - Training happens where data resides
  - Privacy-preserving approach
- Building a Federated Learning System
  - [Flower FL Tutorial](https://flower.dev/docs/framework/tutorial-series-what-is-federated-learning.html)
  - Federated AI Frameworks
    - [Flower](https://flower.dev/)
    - [TensorFlow Federated](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated)
    - [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)
    - [FedML](https://fedml.ai/)

### The Federated Learning Process

1. Global Model Initialization
   - Server initializes model parameters
   - Random or checkpoint-based initialization

2. Model Distribution
   - Server sends model to selected client nodes
   - Subset selection for efficiency
   - Device/organization-level distribution

3. Local Training
   - Clients train on local datasets
   - Limited training duration (epochs/steps)
   - Privacy preservation of local data

4. Model Updates
   - Clients send updates back to server
   - Full parameters or gradients
   - Secure communication protocols

5. Aggregation
   - Server combines client updates
   - Federated Averaging (FedAvg)
   - Weighted averaging based on data size
