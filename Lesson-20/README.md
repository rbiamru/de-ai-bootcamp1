# Lesson 20: The Landscape of Decentralized AI

In this lesson we will explore the current state of the art in the field of Decentralized AI, highlighting the usage of privacy-preserving techniques, decentralized identity, and decentralized storage for AI applications.

We are going to understand how the current landscape of Decentralized AI is rapidly evolving, and how many emerging protocols are trying to set standards for how to leverage blockchain technology for decentralizing the execution of AI applications.

We are going to evaluate the decentralization claims for many of the proposal protocols in face of the blockchain trilemma as we have studied in previous lessons, and we how to properly evaluate the trade-offs between privacy, security, and scalability for each of the proposed protocols.

## Decentralized Identity (DID)

Identity and data management take on new dimensions in DeAI:

- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Self-sovereign identity for AI systems and users
- **Data Wallets**: User-controlled data storage and sharing
- **Consent Management**: Transparent and verifiable data usage permissions
- **Access Control**: Granular control over AI resource access

DID represents a paradigm shift in how we think about digital identity:

1. **Self-Sovereign Identity**
   - Users control their own identity data
   - No central authority needed
   - Portable across different systems
   - Verifiable without revealing sensitive information

2. **Data Ownership**
   - Complete control over personal data
   - Selective disclosure of information
   - Revocable access permissions
   - Transparent data usage tracking

3. **Privacy-Preserving Authentication**
   - Zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification
   - Minimal data exposure
   - Secure authentication protocols
   - Anonymous credentials when needed

### DID Standards and Implementation

1. **Core Components**
   - [W3C DID Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/): The standard for decentralized identifiers
