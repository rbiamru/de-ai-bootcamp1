# Building a Web Page with AI Generated Code

1. Add more content to the [index.html](../examples/index.html) file that you created

   * Example prompt to ask an AI to generate a HTML page with a simple chat interface:

     `Generate an HTML file with a simple chat interface and include a script to send the message somewhere when you click the "generate" button`

     * This simple prompt should be enough for generating the contents an html file to mimic the GUI of our application

2. Ask the AI to generate the code for you and copy the response to your HTML file

   * Some examples from modern AI models are listed below:

     * Meta's `codellama-70b-instruct`: [Response](../examples/response-codellama-70b-instruct.md)

     * OpenAI's `gpt-4-1106-preview`: [Response](../examples/response-gpt-4-1106-preview.md)

     * Anthropic's `claude-3-opus`: [Response](../examples/response-claude-3-opus.md)

3. Pick the answer you found most useful and use it as a starting point for your HTML file

4. Select the [index.html](../examples/index.html) file that you created, open it in your preferred browser, and see how it looks like and how the page works
