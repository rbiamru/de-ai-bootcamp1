# Installing Hugging Face's Transformers

1. Setup a `Virtual Environment` for the project
   - [Tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
   - Run `python -m venv venv/` (Linux/MacOS) or `py -m venv venv/` (Windows) to create a virtual environment on your project's folder
2. Activate the virtual environment
   - venv [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
   - Run `source venv/bin/activate` or `. venv/bin/activate` (Linux/MacOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) to activate the virtual environment
3. Install the `transformers` package with `pip`
   - pip [docs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
   - Run `pip install transformers` to install the `transformers` package
4. Install one of the Machine Learning frameworks compatible with `transformers`
   - Run `pip install 'transformers[torch]'` or `pip install 'transformers[tf-cpu]'` or `pip install 'transformers[flax]'` to install `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow 2.0` or `Flax` respectively
5. Test if your installation was successful
   - Run `python -c "from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline('sentiment-analysis')('I love you'))"` to test if the installation was successful
     - You should get an output similar to this: `[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998704791069031}]`
   - Run `python -c "from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline('sentiment-analysis')('I must confess: I have put pineapple on pizza'))"` to test if your model is thinking correctly
     - If you don't get a `NEGATIVE` sentiment from this, your model is definitely not thinking correctly (in my opinion)
