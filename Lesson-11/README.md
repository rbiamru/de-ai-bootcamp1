# Lesson 11: Leveraging Text Generation WebUI Features

In the previous lesson, we explored how to use the Text Generation WebUI application to run GPT models on our own devices for text generation tasks. Now that we're equipped to run these models, we'll delve deeper into the tool's features and learn how to fine-tune configurations for various models and tasks.

We'll cover the diverse interface options for text generation tasks and explore how to enhance our applications using extensions.

Additionally, we'll utilize the Model Loader tab to gain insights into model functionality and examine how our hardware configuration impacts model performance and output quality.

## Engaging in Dialogue with a Local GPT Model

- Practical exercises
  - Exercise 1: [Implementing Chat Text Generation](./exercises/00-Chat-Text-Generation.md)
  - Exercise 2: [Utilizing Instruct Text Generation](./exercises/01-Instruct-Text-Generation.md)
  - Exercise 3: [Employing Chat-Instruct Text Generation](./exercises/02-Chat-Instruct-Text-Generation.md)
  - Exercise 4: [Exploring the Notebook mode](./exercises/03-Notebook-Mode.md)

## Advanced Features

- Leveraging [Extensions](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/wiki/07-%E2%80%90-Extensions#built-in-extensions)
- Implementing the [API flag](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/wiki/12-%E2%80%90-OpenAI-API)
- [Fine-tuning](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/wiki/05-%E2%80%90-Training-Tab) models

## Replacing OpenAI APIs with Text Generation WebUI APIs

With our newly acquired tool for running GPT models locally, we can now execute **Text Generation** tasks and serve them through a local API, instead of relying on third-party providers like the OpenAI APIs.

By utilizing the built-in OpenAI API Extension from Text Generation WebUI, we can replace calls to OpenAI APIs in our scripts and applications with calls to this local API without any modifications to our code, other than the API endpoint parameter when creating the client.

- Practical exercise
  - Exercise 5: [Implementing the Text Generation WebUI API](./exercises/04-Using-API.md) as a replacement for OpenAI APIs in a Python script
    - Code and execute [LocalCompletion.py](./examples/LocalCompletion.py) to observe how the Text Generation WebUI API can replace OpenAI API calls

## Next Steps

- Exploring additional Text Generation WebUI features
- Developing an application using the local API
- Conducting an in-depth analysis of GPT models
- Weekend project implementation
